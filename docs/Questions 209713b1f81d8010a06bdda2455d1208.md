- Will it always have the same formatted excel files as the ones you sent over, or are they expected to change?

- What needs to happen with the rooms, such as does it need to consider capacity, and does it need to say rooms on the final timetable?

- Must students that have 50% extra time only have one exam or is it just preferable?

- For modules with multiple lecturers is it only the module leader that marks the exam and therefore they’re the only ones that need to be worried about with regards to ‘no module leaders can have more than 1 exam in week 3’?

- In terms of timing is there just a morning and afternoon slot each day, and would it be fine to say just morning or afternoon for the exam as I see some start at 9 and some at 10?

- What to do if a student has two exams with fixed dates same day and one is core like 2000356?
