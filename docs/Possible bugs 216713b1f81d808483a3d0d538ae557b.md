# Possible bugs

Owner: Edward Brady

These are quirks of the code that I believe in the future may cause issues

- [The exam modules](Handling%20data%2020c713b1f81d80529d8de3c3b51da11a.md) must all have the same name so when taking the names from the 2 different files it is important to only select one.
- Some exams don't have a type if not listed in the module list so will be considered standard
